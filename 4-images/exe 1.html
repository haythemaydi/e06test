<STRONG>Berlin </STRONG>(/bɜːrˈlɪn/; German: [bɛʁˈliːn] (About this soundlisten))[7]<mark> <ins >capital and largest city of Germany by both area and population</ins></mark>.[8][9] Its 3.8 million inhabitants make it the European Union's most populous city, according to population within city limits.[2] One of Germany's sixteen constituent states, Berlin is surrounded by the State of Brandenburg and contiguous with Potsdam, Brandenburg's capital. Berlin's urban area, which has a population of around 4.5 million, is the second most populous urban area in Germany after the Ruhr.[3] The Berlin-Brandenburg capital region has over six million inhabitants and is Germany's third-largest metropolitan region after the Rhine-Ruhr and Rhine-Main regions.[10]

<h2 style="color: brown;">Berlin straddles the banks of the Spree, which flows into the Havel (a tributary of the Elbe) in the western borough of Spandau</h2>. <i><sup>the city's main topographical features are the many lakes in the western and southeastern boroughs formed by the Spree,</sup> </i> Havel and Dahme, the largest of which is Lake Müggelsee. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. About one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers, canals and lakes.[11] The city lies in the Central German dialect area, the Berlin dialect being a variant of the Lusatian-New Marchian dialects.<img src="https://www.alpadia.com/sites/default/files/styles/hero_banner_md/public/school/featured/berlin-school-hero-1.jpg?itok=tAS8nW9K">
